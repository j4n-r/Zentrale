# Zentrale

## Metrics & Logging
Use `http://prometheus:9090` as the URL in Grafana (for developing).  
The internal Docker network can resolve it.

## TODOS

### Small
- [ ] add all cores to CPU usage

### Big
- [ ] Add Moodle task scraping  
  - I should be able to discard Moodle tasks and they should no longer appear even though they get refetched
- [ ] Add network monitoring
- [ ] Berlin map to get random place in the Ring
- [ ] Setup Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
